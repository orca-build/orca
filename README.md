Build and maintain many Docker images with the full power of a templating engine and additional developer features.


## How does ORCA work?
Orca is a PHAR executable which is based on the TWIG templating engine.
It allows you to generate different Docker files for building, based on
inheritance and shared components and templates.

The generated isolated Docker files can then be used to build your images when you're ready.

Just roll out global changes on all images and tags by simply adding it to a "global" template.

And the best thing, due to Twig, you're completely flexible in how
you want to build and maintain your image files.

If you're ready, just execute this command:

```ruby
php orca.phar --directory=xyz
```
